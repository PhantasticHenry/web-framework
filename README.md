<h1>Web Framework</h1>
<br>
<p>On this project I learned the importance on Inheritance vs Composition. The main goal was to create a some sort of UI framework using some sort of view-model pattern. At the end I created a really basic framework that allowed me to create components and interact with them. Inspirations of styles and conventions comes from Marionette.js and Backbone.js framework.</p>
